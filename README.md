Packet Arena is an interactive, browser-based strategy game that simulates real-world networking challenges within gameplay. Players compete in tactical matches where network conditions such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth become strategic variables. Before each match, players receive a pool of “Network Points” that they can allocate to manipulate network parameters — either handicapping their opponent or challenging themselves for bonus rewards. During battle, both players engage in real-time mini-games or routing challenges where these impairments are actively simulated, forcing them to adapt to unpredictable network environments.
